\title{Conduct Statistical Power Analysis for Two-Sample T-Tests}
\usage{
power_analysis(effect_sizes, sample_sizes, alpha = 0.05, n_simulations = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{effect_sizes}{Numeric vector of effect sizes to evaluate. These represent
the mean differences between treatment and control groups in standard
deviation units (Cohen's d).}

\item{sample_sizes}{Numeric vector of sample sizes to evaluate. These represent
the total sample size (will be split equally between groups).}

\item{alpha}{Significance level for hypothesis testing (Type I error rate).
Default is 0.05.}

\item{n_simulations}{Number of Monte Carlo simulations to run for each
combination of effect size and sample size. Default is 1000.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing:
\itemize{
\item effect_size: Evaluated effect size
\item sample_size: Evaluated sample size
\item power: Estimated statistical power (proportion of significant results)
}
}
\description{
Performs Monte Carlo simulation-based power analysis for two-sample t-tests
by evaluating different combinations of effect sizes and sample sizes.
}
\details{
The function assumes:
\itemize{
\item Equal sample sizes between groups
\item Normal distribution of data
\item Equal variances between groups
\item Two-sided alternative hypothesis
Power is estimated using Monte Carlo simulation by generating data under
the alternative hypothesis and calculating the proportion of significant results.

# Basic usage
power_results <- power_analysis(
  effect_sizes = seq(0.5, 2, 0.5),
  sample_sizes = c(50, 100, 200)
)

# More precise estimation with more simulations
precise_results <- power_analysis(
  effect_sizes = c(0.3, 0.5, 0.8),
  sample_sizes = seq(20, 100, 20),
  n_simulations = 5000
)

# Plot results
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(power_results, aes(x = sample_size, y = power, color = factor(effect_size))) +
  geom_line() +
