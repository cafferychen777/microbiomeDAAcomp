\usage{
run_daa_methods(
  data = NULL,
  count_matrix = NULL,
  group_info = NULL,
  methods = c("DESeq2", "ALDEx2", "ANCOM-BC"),
  alpha = 0.05,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A list containing count matrix and group information, or a phyloseq object}

\item{count_matrix}{Optional matrix of counts if not providing full data object.
Rows represent features (e.g., taxa), columns represent samples}

\item{group_info}{Optional factor of group assignments if not providing full data object.
Must match the order of samples in count_matrix}

\item{methods}{Character vector of method names to run. Options:
\itemize{
\item "DESeq2": Differential expression analysis based on negative binomial distribution
\item "ALDEx2": ANOVA-like differential expression procedure
\item "ANCOM-BC": Analysis of composition of microbiomes with bias correction
}}

\item{alpha}{Significance level for differential abundance calling (default: 0.05)}

\item{p_adjust_method}{Method for p-value adjustment. Options include:
"BH" (default), "bonferroni", "holm", "hochberg", "BY"}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to individual methods}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item results: List of results from each method
\item summary: Data frame comparing results across methods
\item runtime: Vector of computation times for each method
\item parameters: List of parameters used for each method
}
}
\description{
Run multiple differential abundance analysis (DAA) methods on microbiome data
and return standardized results for comparison. Supports multiple popular methods including
DESeq2, ALDEx2, and ANCOM-BC.
}
\details{
Run Multiple DAA Methods

The function handles:
\itemize{
\item Input validation and data preprocessing
\item Method-specific parameter optimization
\item Error handling and warnings
\item Standardization of results across methods
\item Performance timing
}
}

\dontrun{
# Using phyloseq object
data(GlobalPatterns)

# Using count matrix and group info
