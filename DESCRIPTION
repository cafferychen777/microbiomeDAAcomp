Description: A comprehensive toolkit for comparing and evaluating Differential 
    Abundance Analysis (DAA) methods in microbiome studies. The package addresses 
    key challenges in microbiome data analysis including data sparsity, 
    compositionality, and overdispersion. It provides tools for data import and 
    simulation, method execution and comparison, performance evaluation, 
    sensitivity analysis, and result visualization. Designed to help researchers 
    select appropriate DAA methods based on their data characteristics while 
    integrating seamlessly with existing microbiome analysis packages.
